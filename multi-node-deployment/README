Steps to deploy Openstack based multi-node environment using Ansible 

0 - The script assumes the following home directory path:

/home/ubuntu/DecFL

1 - Install Ansible. 
Follow step-1 from the link: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-ansible-on-ubuntu-18-04

2 - Setup the inventory file as following: 

---- inventory file, path: /etc/ansible/hosts -----
localhost        ansible_connection=local
---------------------------------------------------

3 - Generate an SSH key and push the public key in the cloud. 

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

4 - Start ssh-agent and add the SSH-key to the agent.

$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
$ ssh-add -k ~/.ssh/private-key

5 - Download RC file from the cloud and set the environment variables. 

$ source ./openstack.rc

6 - create a key.txt file in the "~/DecFL/multi-node-deployment". The file need to contain the ethereum private keys (one per line).

7 - Run gen_vars.py, "python3 gen_vars.py <number of VMs you want to start>" for example "python3 gen_vars.py 2" 

8 - Run the Ansible playbook. 

$ ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False ansible-playbook decfl_deploy.yaml

9 - The deployment script will setup new VMs, install Docker and create an indentity file "~/app/identity" on each newly created VM. 
 
10 - The deployment will generate a new inventory file "inventory_file" in the same directory based on the newly started VMs.
